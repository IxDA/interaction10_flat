		<description><![CDATA[Just came back from IDEA09 and had a wonderful time play-testing Social Mania (the name of the game). It has enough complexity to keep you interested without having too steep a learning curve. I love how it mixes intra-team rounds with cross-team sabotage. Plus the crazy time limits. It&#039;s really cool  how well it brings real-life social product design analogy to a dynamic gameplay and flow. Just brilliant. I can&#039;t wait to play again.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great idea! Maybe add some &quot;real life&quot; hurdles such as challenging client statements halfway the design process, throwing teams back at the WHY of it all.
Thanks,
