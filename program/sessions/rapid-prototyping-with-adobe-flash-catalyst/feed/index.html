		<description><![CDATA[Hi Dante, I was planning on showing how I have been using the tool as UX designer. It is a new tool, so I will still need to show the basics and you will get some overlap with what other demos have shown. Can you ellaborate on what you mean by: &quot;...showed off the features of the product but didn’t really incorporate much context from other designers&quot;. It should help me steer the direction of the demo.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Can you give more of a sense of what you&#039;ll be demonstrating?  I am very interested in learning more about the product, but have already seen demos from Adobe staff that showed off the features of the product but didn&#039;t really incorporate much context from other designers.  If this is going to be audience-directed, then I am much more interested.  Especially if the sample files can be shared.]]></description>
