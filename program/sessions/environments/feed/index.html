		<description><![CDATA[Kendra, you never cease to amaze with your level of creativity and ingenuity. This workshop sounds like a very practical exploration of the human motion and its effect on everyday experiences... yet I&#039;m sure it&#039;s something that few people have considered. This is a great start to learning how these experiences can be improved... and fun! The activity portion of the workshop sounds like a great way of getting everyone involved. Much better than the typical presentation. I can&#039;t wait to see the video if there is one!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Kendra. I hope you get to present this session. It sounds interesting and I wish I could join you. I think its really interesting to think about movement and gestural interfaces not in terms of creating the next bespoke product, but to work towards defining a framework for gestural interfaces that involve the entire body and is sensor agnostic.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is definitely an interesting conversation to be had here. I love the idea of getting us away from being &quot;button pushers&quot; and actually moving and interacting with objects and space - what the human body was designed to do!

I am very curious to learn about the different spaces that fit well with this concept, and also the spaces that don&#039;t fit well with it. Does it work for paying my cable bill as well as it does for more fluid or metaphorical gestures?

Sure to be a great presentation. Good luck, Kendra!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How interesting.  This idea and presentation is a natural fit for Kendra.  Anyone attending would not only walk away learning alot but would enjoy the process.

Good luck!]]></description>
