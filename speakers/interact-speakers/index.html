<p>Barbara Holmes has been working in interface design and content development since 1989, when she participated as a lead instructional designer in the development of a series of computer-based, laserdisc (who remembers those?) training courses for Nissan Motors. Since then, she’s worked as a freelancer, on staff, and at agencies, designing a wide range of digital training and simulations for the military, medical, oil extraction, automotive, financial, high tech, higher education and public non-profit sectors. During the last nine years she’s transitioned her focus from pure instructional design to information architect/interaction designer, and now works in the agency/vendor world. Currently a Senior Information Architect at ISITE Design in Portland, Oregon, she unites her passions for user-centered design and a deep love of meaningful content to teach, preach and practice usability, plus design interfaces for software applications, social networking, B2C and B2B websites. She is a senior member of the Society for Technical Communicators and also a member of ASTD, CHIFOO, and one of the planning board members of IxDA Portland. A lifelong learner, Barbara has completed training in usability techniques, project management, instructional design and interaction design techniques from industry conferences. She received an undergraduate degree from University of California, Berkeley and a graduate degree from San Diego State University.</p>

<h4>Dan Willis</h4>
<h4>Donna Spencer</h4>
<p>Dan Willis has been building Web products and creating “no-duh” deliverables for something like a hundred years and although he usually hides behind his alter ego UX Crank, he has agreed not to wear a mask for the duration of this session. At least not on his face.</p>
<p>Donna Spencer is a freelance information architect, interaction designer, world-renowned speaker and workshop leader, and author of a wildly popular book about card sorting. (Seriously, it’s bigger than “The Da Vinci Code” in Slovenia.) She’s Australian so she talks funny and laughs a lot, both of which should make Visual Thinker’s Pictionary a big hit.</p>
