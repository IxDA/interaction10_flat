		<description><![CDATA[I also followed the IDEA 09 tweets for this presentation, and was sorry to have missed seeing it in person. Sounds like I may have another shot at it.

BTW I&#039;m glad to see architecture finally being formally acknowledged as an important source of ideas for our profession. Some of us (those who come from architecture backgrounds) have long been aware of the relevance and clear parallels that exist between the two fields. I&#039;d love to hear Christina&#039;s take on this!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This will definitely be a different version-- i had a ton of stuff I hadn&#039;t synthesized yet, and of course the great feedback I received at IDEA and will get here will be incorporated. The field of architecture has so much knowledge to give us. I have found this a rich body of knowledge to mine.]]></description>
