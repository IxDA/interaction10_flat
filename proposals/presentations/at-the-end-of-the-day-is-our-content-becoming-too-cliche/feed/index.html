		<description><![CDATA[I think it sounds interesting, after all content is king, and most people are not interested in your product. But they are interested in what it can do for them and them is now lots of specific groups online. You can target them each with their own content as you need not run out of printing space. But it needs to be good, and finding that good value is still not easy for companies on their own.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Of course, by &quot;bossy&quot; we mean &quot;one who educates, informs, gently guides, suggests brilliant ideas, and serves divine wines and mouthwatering appetizers while doing so.&quot; Look it up! It&#039;s true!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So funny that you&#039;d say &quot;bossy and wordy.&quot; That is precisely how I have often described why it is that I am both a web writer and a strategist: &#039;Hi. I&#039;m a bossy writer.&quot; I&#039;ve even labeled myself that way in various project Basecamps. :) 

It comes, of course, from digging in to work on the words and other content, which you do with the dear reader in mind (the client, too), and  discovering all the obstacles, confusion, omissions, awkward paths, as well as incongruities in brand, voice, design, proposed content, navigation, emphasis, audience, business goals, etc. You find yourself saying repeatedly, &quot;Um, but...&quot; and thus a bossy writer, er, strategist, is born. It is critically important to be there at the beginning of a project. Hope you are able to give this talk!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Al - you&#039;re dead right. I call this Copy Tetris syndrome, we have all the pieces and we have the spaces so now we just have to make it fit right? If you&#039;re good, no-one ever notices it wasn&#039;t planned that way in advance but really, more often than not, it looks like you&#039;ve jammed it in any old how that doesn&#039;t disrupt the &#039;look&#039; of the site.

I&#039;m a big advocate of writers and content strategists being there working alongside IAs and designers right from the beginning - something I&#039;ll be covering in this talk. 

Another analogy I use is that of an artisan bakery: the bakers care about bread, they love to talk about bread recipes, experiment and make great bread. Most of their customers appreciate a good loaf but when it comes down to it, they want the bread to be part of a yummy sandwich. If the bread is amazing but the filling is bland, it&#039;ll still be a crappy sandwich. Same with websites, if the design is astounding, the code a work to rival a sketch of Da Vinci, the interaction design heaven sent but the content as dull as ditchwater and/or a last minute botch, it&#039;ll still be a crap site to use overall. Just a goodlookin&#039;, well functioning crap site!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Copywriters on the web all too often seem to play a game of fill in the gaps, which is quite inadequate and won&#039;t attract the creative copywriters who play such a central part in traditional advertising. This is an area which really interests me at the moment, particularly how and where copywriters should sit within a creative web team and whether they be central to the creative process and heavily involved with coming up with ideas  alongside designers and ia&#039;s, and how this might work in practice.]]></description>
