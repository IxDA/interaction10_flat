		<description><![CDATA[This is a great presentation topic. One major gap between grad school and industry is the inclusion of considerations that don&#039;t always exist in the classroom (e.g., development timelines, technological limitations). The practical challenges (and benefits!) of working with cross-disciplinary teams are often addressed at a high-level in the university ... the first few projects after graduation can be eye-opening.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The big thing I would liek to see mentioned in this prezo is the transition from school oriented partial project life cycles to business world full project life cycles. The number one thing that trips &quot;fresh form the oven&quot; HCI&#039;s up is that they start work on a project and need to stick with it far longer than is the case when working on class work that is rarely longer than a semester.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great idea for a presentation.  It serves a target market that often does not have much for them at a conference like this.  In addition, many of us, myself included, have no formal academic background in this field and it provides us with a great reference as to what is being taught in schools right now.

One more thing...the &quot;U of M&quot; is &lt;i&gt;Minnesota&lt;/i&gt; :)]]></description>
