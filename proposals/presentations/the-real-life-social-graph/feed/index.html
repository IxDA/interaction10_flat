		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m very interested in the reality of how people live, not the skewed view we tend to get when so many of our friends work (and seemingly live) online.

I&#039;ve discussed this very idea with clients who seem to think a Web site or content strategy or social network will transform their businesses. Too many appear to have difficulty with the idea that online social interactions are a slim slice of one&#039;s life, and not where the focus needs to be.

Can you discuss some of the &quot;digital meets non-digital&quot; tools that you use in your work to support real-world interactions and relationships?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sounds like a great talk. I would love to hear the research bits about where you&#039;ve found disconnects between current tools and needs, and whether your research has shown certain interactions that just can&#039;t be modeled in software.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the feedback Erin! 
I&#039;ll be presenting research findings on: 
- how people use current digital tools to communicate with different people
- how and where current tools don&#039;t meet people&#039;s needs for communication/socializing online

I&#039;ll also be presenting ideas for how to use this data to design better online experiences.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Will you be presenting ideas or questions to spark brainstorms and ideation for how to address this gap between the current tools and the real world? Sounds like an interesting talk and would love to hear more about the info and then what to do with it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comments folks. 
Jenny speaks to a core part of this talk - that our social web tools are still very crude and map badly to the many complexities and nuances of our real life relationships.
This talk is about addressing this problem and will focus on concrete actionable recommendations.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is interesting work, in being substantial research that speaks to the disconnects between social networks as they are structured and used on the web, and social networks as they are realized in real life. How can we better support the social interactions in a non-online world? How too, might we understand how maintaining social connectedness via online tools, might be changing the dynamics of off-line social relationships?]]></description>
