		<description><![CDATA[@Andrew

Good point re: SMART; kind of thought blowing it out might blow make some of the slides irrelevant, but it&#039;s a good point, for certain!

@Shelly - I&#039;m hopeful we&#039;ll be able to discuss! :-)

@Jeff

I&#039;ve been in organizations like that, and there&#039;s a bit of discussion around whether or not UXers are becoming &quot;the next BAs&quot;--in recent years, I&#039;ve seen fewer and fewer BAs in the organizations I&#039;ve worked with (both from a consultant perspective and an innie).  I think that this presentation is for those in BA-less organizations, however, you&#039;re making me think that maybe it&#039;s for BAs, too (and UXers), for figuring out the grey spaces a bit better.

Really, really appreciate the feedback!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This sounds really valuable, Russ, especially its emphasis on stacking personas and user needs against business reqs. 

In my organization, it&#039;s the Business Analyst who flushes out these requirements and generates a BRD; would your presentation discuss how to collaborate with a BA, or is this really for people in BA-less situations?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Excellent topic! 

I&#039;m especially interested in how you suggest going about the political stickiness that usually accompanies this sort of confusion in a project. Often the mushy direction is due to people avoiding confrontation and such. 

Small point: Leading with the bullet about SMART feels weaker than leading with the couple ofter it (especially the &#039;break through the BS&#039; one), so maybe reshuffle those? (Also, not everyone may get the SMART acronym)]]></description>
