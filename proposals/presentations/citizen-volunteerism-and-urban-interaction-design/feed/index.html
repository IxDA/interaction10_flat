		<description><![CDATA[Dan- Thanks! I was worried I&#039;d gotten a bit buzzwordy; I&#039;m glad the spirit of my proposal still got across. :)

Elizabeth- Thank you! I hope you can; we&#039;ll see, eh? 

Funny, I use to love reading Dan Lockton&#039;s stuff some years ago (I think maybe his blog used to be called Architectures of Control then?) - but he&#039;d totally slipped off my radar until you mentioned his name. He was one of the people who kick-started my fascination with Las Vegas. I&#039;m happy to have him in my bookmarks again. But I digress. :) 

I had been thinking of things less in terms of &quot;controlling&quot; public space and more in terms of agencies being &quot;charged with&quot; or &quot;entrusted with&quot; space (since in most cases, the public gives up no legal control - and can, with much political will, dissolve the agency at their whim). I&#039;d done that in part consciously, because &quot;entrusting&quot; acknowledges the fact that these committees were originally created out of some necessity - and in part subconsciously, because to me &quot;control&quot; is an uncomfortably loaded term that implies giving &quot;Control&quot; of &quot;Our&quot; stuff to &quot;The Man.&quot;  ;) Seriously though, part of volunteerism to me is a sense of optimism, and a lot of very fiercely &quot;anti-establishment&quot; urban technology seems to discuss government&#039;s &quot;control over&quot; public space at the expense of exploring government&#039;s &quot;role in&quot; public space (and how technology, both ours and that of the government, will change that role over time).

That said, there is definitely a real sense of control that gets projected into a space - for reasons both benign (like limiting public liability and ensuring public safety) and malicious (like ensuring one&#039;s job safety). Some specific opportunities might lie where different levels of control in a space can achieve the same means - or even where the public can be trusted to &quot;override&quot; some of that control temporarily? 

Well, now you&#039;ve got me pondering. I&#039;m excited to have an excuse to re-read his stuff and see how it all might tie together. Do let me know what you think (and if my ramblings are on cue with the sort of thoughts you were having.) Does anyone know if Lockton frequents Interaction or the IXDA scene?]]></description>
