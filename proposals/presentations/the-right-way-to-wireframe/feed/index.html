		<description><![CDATA[@Christopher Fahey

You know, that&#039;s a pretty kick-ass idea with some real legs to it.  The timing may be a bit tricky due to a couple of other things, but I don&#039;t see any reason why we shouldn&#039;t be able to do something like that.

Thanks for helping make this even better--love that thought!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love this idea. Rarely do conference speakers actually show their chops &lt;i&gt;as practitioners&lt;/i&gt;, so that alone will be refereshing and fun. And by requiring the presenters to all solve the same problem, presumably each with substantial skills but different approaches and styles, the audience will have the benefit of comparing and discussing the approaches without having to adjust for different contexts -- apples to apples, etc. Again, actually looking at &lt;i&gt;real design work&lt;/i&gt; in a critical light is something surprisingly rare at professional conferences.

Can I make one suggestion: The assignment that is given to the four &quot;panelists&quot; should be released to the public at the same time. That way, the audience can ruminate on the design challenges in advance of the session, think about how they might approach the problem (giving them something to mentally compare with the presenters&#039; work). Perhaps some audience members will even sketch up a few ideas of their own. &lt;i&gt;I&#039;d&lt;/i&gt; be tempted to.]]></description>

Concrete examples are gold. It&#039;s good to talk about &#039;how&#039; we do the math.
