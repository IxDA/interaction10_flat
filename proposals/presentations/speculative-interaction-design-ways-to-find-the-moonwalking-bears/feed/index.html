		<description><![CDATA[Livia,

Thanks for the comment. I saw an experienced several things that were unlike anything I&#039;ve experienced before. I observed people who told me they could receive blessings through the internet others told me how the devil used technology to infiltrate their lives. Pentecostalism is a growing globally and I think it is important to understand how users with radically different perspectives about technology-different perspectives from  those commonly discussed in the IxD community-use it is important. Finally, these new perspectives can inspire interesting design concepts.

Thanks again!]]></description>
