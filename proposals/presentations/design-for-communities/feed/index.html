		<description><![CDATA[Susan, 
Thanks for taking the time to read and comment on our submission. 

To answer your questions: Your absolutely right- there&#039;s a lot of knowledge and people investigating virtual communities. 

Just to be clear, the objective of our submission is NOT restricted to virtual communities. But rather sharing our professional observations and insights with fellow design practitioners who are interested in the relationships between how brands, organizations engage and interact with consumer’s and communities in today’s changing economy.

More specifically, we&#039;ll be leveraging problem solving strategies in the area of Social Anthropology (Arjun Appadurai), Business Model Design (Alex Osterwalder), Customer Experience models (Nigel Hill, Colin Shaw/ J Ivens, Berndt H Schmitt) and Consumer models (EJ Arnould, CJ Thompson) to communicate an action orientated process, ie the right tools and methodologies to deconstruct and reconstruct a problem.

Simply put, the central premise of our submission is that there is a misalignment between how brands, organizations view and engage with consumers and communities. We want to looks at ways of bridging that gap between between business and design.

I hope that answers your question’s around what issues we’re attempting to tackle and why you should attend. 

Look forward to the opportunity to connect at the conference.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi guys,
Susan is right; there is a lot of stuff done in this space already. But! I don&#039;t think enough design researchers have practical experience with grounded theory or phenomenology.

I for one would love to see UX designers use grounded theory properly, as well as phenomenological approaches. 

Why should someone come to this talk? 

I&#039;d go to see practical uses of both those robust approaches to qualitative research. 

Susan&#039;s also right - some of the text is a bit wordy. Maybe you could simplify it a bit?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Susan! It&#039;s great to see you&#039;ve been so active in commenting already.

Personally I feel that regardless how much work has been done in a space, that doesn&#039;t mean everyone knows about it.

This is up for debate, but since IxDA is very practitioner-focussed, with everyone coming from different academic backgrounds, I feel that talks at IxD don&#039;t always need to be groundbreaking: they just need to discuss a timely and interesting topic that some (preferably large) subset of the IxDA community would find valuable.

In this particular case, I&#039;d wager not many people in our community know about Amy Jo Kim or Amy Bruckman -- but maybe a talk like this would introduce them to the topic so that they&#039;re inclined to do more independent reading themselves.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a huge space and there is tons of existing work that has already been done in it. Things that come to mind are Amy Jo Kim&#039;s seminal book &quot;Community building on the web: Secret strategies for successful online communities.&quot; 

For people that are interested in this space take a look at the available resources on this online syllabus: http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2001/cs6470_fall/ Everything that the presenters describe as takeaways can be found on this syllabus.

So what do you bring that is new to this space? Why should someone come to your talk when so much prior work has been done in this space?

Finally, please clarify what you mean by &quot;emerging socio-technological ecosystems, &quot;organizational and consumer centric models&quot; and &quot;exploratory action driven process and methodology.&quot; 

Good luck!]]></description>
