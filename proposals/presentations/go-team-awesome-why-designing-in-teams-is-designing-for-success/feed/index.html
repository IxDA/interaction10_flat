		<description><![CDATA[Hi Dante - Thanks for your feedback, it&#039;s right on the mark.  In our experiences we&#039;ve found that the challenges on both the organizational and team dynamics levels present their own unique problems to solve.  Throughout our presentation we&#039;ll address the common scenarios you&#039;ll encounter on both sides and how to address them successfully.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice topic, one in which I am a firm believer.  I hope you&#039;ll address both &quot;fronts&quot; in this conflict; the reticence of organizations to engage multiple resources, and the insecurity of individual designers.  I&#039;ve found that too many have failed to gain adoption for team design because they didn&#039;t know how to win BOTH sides of the argument.

Best of luck with this.]]></description>
