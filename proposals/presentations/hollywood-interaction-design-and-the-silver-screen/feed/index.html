		<description><![CDATA[This session sounds like fun. It&#039;s interesting to consider how depictions of the future say quite a lot more about the present. Perhaps films took over these depictions from spectacles like The World&#039;s Fair? The 1933 Chicago World&#039;s fair had some facinating images. Their deterministic motto makes me wonder whether they were really optimistic or resigned: &quot;Science Finds, Industry Applies, Man Conforms.&quot; The New York 1939 World&#039;s fair with its &quot;world of tomorrow&quot; theme explicitly set out to imagine the future (just when things seemed particularly bleak for the world). So much of the 30&#039;s and 40&#039;s seemed dedicated to imagining future domestic technologies. Does it seem like the futures we imagine now are all interfaces for public spaces and work?]]></description>

And thanks for the vote of confidence!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really love this idea. In fact, this is the topic of a class I am teaching. It&#039;s important to recognize how some of the interfaces in fiction don&#039;t exist not just because the technology doesn&#039;t exist (Star Trek transporters) but also because the interfaces are often inherently un-usable (to be a user of those Minority Report UIs you must have massive &quot;gorilla arms&quot; to hold your arms horizontal for hours and hours). Kaleem will bring a lot to this one, I suspect.

The title, however, is a little redundant. Hollywood = Silver Screen. Sorry to be pedantic!]]></description>
