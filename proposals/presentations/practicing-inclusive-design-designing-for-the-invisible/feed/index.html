		<description><![CDATA[I would love to learn about your inclusive design process and methodologies for &quot;extreme users&quot;.

At our meetups in the Toronto UX community we have had some discussions about the idea of designing for &quot;edge cases&quot; -- users and scenarios that fall outside of the mainstream (or &quot;extreme users&quot; in your vocabulary) -- making designs for everyone better.

If you do travel to Savannah, I would appreciate it if you could bring samples of the Doro phones you plan to discuss. 

Capturing knowledge and transmitting it is always a challenge because we often aren&#039;t given time in a project plan to do so in a formal way. How do you apply insights from one project to others? Do you plan to include this in your presentation?]]></description>
