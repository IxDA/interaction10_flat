<h4>Session Title</h4>
<p>The Relationship between Industrial Design and Interaction Design in Information and Communication Technologies Embedded Product Development Activity</p>
<h4>Presenter</h4>
<p>Canan Akoglu, Yildiz Technical University and Alpay Er, Istanbul Technical University</p>
<h4>Session Type: Presentation</h4>
<p>The Relationship between Industrial Design and Interaction Design in Information and Communication Technologies Embedded Product Development Activity</p>
<p>This research describes the role of interaction design in information and communication technologies (ICT) embedded product design and development activity. Besides presenting the relationship between industrial design and interaction design in the same activity, it also re-defines this relationship in terms of roles in ICT embedded product development activity.</p>
<p>This research has been accomplished by having an extensive interdisciplinary literature review, a series of interviews and also by having a case study based on a specific product&#8217;s design and development process. The series of interviews have been conducted face to face in USA with professionals from 5 different industrial design and interaction design based consulting firms such as IDEO, Cooper Interaction, Smart Design, Swim Interaction Design Studio and LUNAR Design. The next step of the field research has been a case study based on gathering information of a spesific product through secondary sources and then conducting in-depth interviews with designers, who have worked in that product&#8217;s design and development process, from different professions. </p>
<p>Major conclusions of the research include:</p>
<p>-Being a younger discipline relative to industrial design, the role of interaction design in ICT embedded product design and development activity had the similarities to that of industrial design in the same activity.<br />
-The most extensive collaboration between industrial design and interaction design is seen at Planning and Concept Design stages in ICT embedded product development activity.<br />
-It comes out that besides designing interactions, interaction designers work as user researchers and design managers in ICT embedded product development activity. As the products become more and more complex in terms of interactions, interaction designers will gradually need to manage the design and development teams. There will be a need for a new sub-field of interaction design which is supposed to emerge as interaction design management.<br />
-Comparing with industrial design, interaction design is foreseen to have a wider activity area in Planning, Concept Development and System Level Design stages of ICT embedded product development activity.<br />
-As interactions with products become more and more immaterial, service design is supposed to turn out to be a new actor in ICT embedded product design and development activity.</p>
