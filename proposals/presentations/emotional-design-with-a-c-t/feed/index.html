		<description><![CDATA[This sounds great Trevor. I appreciate Kaleem&#039;s concerns about being prescriptive, especially given the history of from-the-mountaintop usability rules. However, I think that simply addressing how to do something in a practical sense has great value. 

We all know that there are many different ways to prototype or user test or cardsort. But when you&#039;re first learning new concepts you need a starting point - a practical anchor. 

And orthodox thinking is probably more about the individual than how a method is described.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kaleem,
I think you raise a really good point and I appreciate your thoughts. Some of these models come from industrial design, where they&#039;ve been employed for some time.

Rather than debating whether one particular model has more relative merit than another, my approach has been to compare a number of models to see what it is they all have in common, and then to express those commonalities in more prescriptive language.

It appears to me that one of the main factors which has limited the adoption of these models by practitioners is the highly academic and descriptive language used by their creators. We&#039;re all familiar with the large gains that can be made by using more intuitive language and labeling, and that what I&#039;ve tried to do here. 

I believe this area is so complex that even a more prescriptive model isn&#039;t likely to force practitioners into orthodox ways of thinking or a cookie-cutter approach.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m curious if a prescriptive model is the right approach and if it leads to orthodox ways of thinking. 

We are in early days of intentionally creating emotional experiences for the type of work that most of us do. Would a discussion of the comparative merits of the descriptive models be better? Do we want to favour a prescriptive model vs. experimentation with a variety of approaches to learn which are most effective at being affective? 

Thanks for asking for my feedback, Trevor. I hope it helps]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This could be the concept that will trancend the different forms of design.  I am an interior designer and believe that a full understanding of the emotional and social response to design will take a client from a programmatic concept through to a wholistic and successful design solution.  If there is a model that is more prescriptive, I would love to see this be described in a way that could be integrated into design practice, regardless of which design you may practice.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sounds great! I like seeing the psychological and emotional sides being addressed and as someone involved with, but far from an expert in UX, would be really interested in see a more perscriptive approach to it all!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d love to see this presentation-- I&#039;ve heard just a bit about Trevor&#039;s ACT model and would love to know more (I still reference his IA Summit presentation from a few years back). Knowing Trevor, he has some solid, refined thinking that I&#039;m sure we&#039;ll all find very useful to both project work and to help frame our conversations!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Trevor has been thinking, writing, and presenting about emotional design for a long time. He&#039;s also currently writing a story for Boxes and Arrows on this particular topic, and as his editor I have a some insight into the ideas behind this presentation. I think this would make a great presentation, and would be very useful for the Interaction10 audience. I look forward to seeing it!]]></description>
