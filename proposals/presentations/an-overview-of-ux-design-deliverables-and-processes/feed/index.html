		<description><![CDATA[Actually Peter, your Agile stuff is better... and more &#039;what to do&#039;. For practitioners it&#039;s more relevant. It was what was missing from this wknds presentations. I had people comment in general about that. No &#039;take aways&#039;. I personally deal w/ a lot of OOTB that needs to be fully customised... Internal SAP, HR, etc... giant global. No one ever covers... hmmm...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Because there are many basic UX conferences. If it was basic and focused on interaction design, it would be one thing (like Dave&#039;s from last year). If it was web centric, it would be one thing (like Leisa&#039;s case study). But the combo of basic, one medium,  and not focused on IxD that I was objecting to. This would be a great talk at SxSW or WebVisions. 

As for Marc&#039;s talk, well, that was a keynote. Different rules apply. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No need for apologies, Dan, if you can answer me this: What&#039;s wrong with basic, what&#039;s wrong with web-centric, and what&#039;s wrong with looking beyond the strictest definition of interaction design?

Not to disrespect these individual presenters (hi!) but:
- How is Dave Malouf&#039;s &quot;Foundations of Interaction Design&quot; from last year (http://interaction09.crowdvine.com/talks/show/2628) not basic?
- How is Leisa Reichelt&#039;s &quot;The Drupal.org redesign&quot; (http://interaction09.crowdvine.com/talks/show/2592) not web centric?
- And how is Marc Rettig&#039;s &quot;How to Change Complicated Stuff (e.g., the World)&quot; (http://interaction09.crowdvine.com/talks/show/2622) strictly about interaction design?]]></description>
