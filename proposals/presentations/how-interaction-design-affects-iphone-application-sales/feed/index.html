		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t help but ask this question. If &quot;ideally&quot; your presentation would involve audience members, why did you submit is as a presentation? If you believe a discussion format is the most appropriate, perhaps you could re-submit your proposal as a &quot;discussion.&quot; I would love to share my App Store experience with others who have developed apps and sold them. 

Good luck!]]></description>
