		<description><![CDATA[I love real-life, lessons learned.  One thing I&#039;ve always found particularly challenging with replacing old systems is how much to keep of the old way to leverage existing expertise and how much to try new, seemingly better ways.  Hopefully you have some good insights on how to discern this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dan - this sounds like a case study people could learn some great stuff from. I&#039;m not sure the main point is coming through crystal clear in your description, though. Maybe lead with the main point, then get into the more creative stage-setting? And make sure you&#039;re spelling out the concrete benefits or &quot;new stuff&quot; people should walk away with after the talk. (Those of us who have seen you present know you&#039;ll be engaging and lead us to the point in an interesting way -- but others may not know that yet :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Liv: Yup, what you said plus what Kaleem said. We&#039;re simplifying the system for the user at the same time we&#039;re actually relying on arcane techniques and knowledge MORE. It&#039;s a pretty unique challenge which I hope will make it an interesting case study, but I think it&#039;ll also have value for more traditional projects.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am fascinated by this case study as Dan has presented it. It sounds as though increasingly arcane techniques and knowledge are required to successfully navigate the strata of complex systems in the project described. Knowing Dan, it will be presented with the dry wit and good humour he is known for.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;depends on it&quot; - what it? That every user is unique?

So it&#039;s a case study of moving from legacy systems to new simpler system focusing on what user knowledge is really &quot;how well they hack&quot; versus what they really need to know... right?]]></description>
