		<description><![CDATA[This should be a very interesting and relevant talk. Simona can draw from her years of experience leading the successful design or redesign of several major search projects at eBay, Shopping.com, and a number of startup companies. She has spent thousands of hours studying site metrics, customer behavior, search queries, and other relevant inputs. Combined with her very engaging style of presentation, this should ensure Simona and Greg&#039;s talk will be one of the highlights of the conference.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This should prove to be an insightful session - too often company search strategies are simply &quot;make it like Google,&quot; without fully considering the needs of a search experience within a particular context.  Simona and Greg&#039;s experience at eBay should be tremendously helpful, as it includes a number of search types (product search, people search, help documentation search), as well as the gamut of data types being searched (from highly structured information such as book catalogs to the completely unstructured space of user submitted content such as grilled cheese sandwiches!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Simona is one of those designers who can understand, synthesize, and communicate customer needs through visualization by partnering with research. Research includes web analytic, ethnographic studies,  usability testing, etc. Her visualization aligns cross-functional teams to the same page. She bases her designs on customer needs; it shows up on many projects that she has done at eBay. 

Either you already have a lot of background on eCommerce Search or just want to learn more, this session will be engaging and have a lot of insightful conversation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I encourage you to accept Greg&#039;s proposal. He&#039;s been writing an excellent series of articles on search for UXmatters, which has garnered great interest from our readers. His talk would be great addition to the conference. I&#039;m sure it would be a very popular session.]]></description>
