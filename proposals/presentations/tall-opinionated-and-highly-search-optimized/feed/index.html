		<description><![CDATA[This topic is especially important given that content is now being served on so many different platforms/media - many of which strip out design altogether (e.g. RSS, content sharing partnerships).  Sometimes, in the dark of night, all you have left is the content.  I&#039;d love to learn more about how to convince clients how to make it shine.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll 3rd Anya&#039;s angle: this opinionated content should be the organizing principle of the site, not &quot;the stuff inside&quot; the site.  Maybe use that as a wedge to get CS &quot;baked in&quot;? 

Also thoughts on getting clients to recognize the need for explicit, thought-out content strategy BEFORE it becomes a glaring need -- the &quot;ouch, yeah okay, about that content strategy phase you mentioned long ago...&quot; part -- would be tee-rific to hear.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Content strategy talk would be an excellent subject for UX folks, especially those like myself working in environments where a content strategist isn&#039;t a permanent position. Would love to see/hear examples of practices and suggestions that people in these types of situations might take away.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a great topic -- addressing the quality &amp; consistency aspects of your content rather than mere quantity and mass. It&#039;s about intelligently producing content that is different, meaningful and inspirational so you can really connect with and grow your base. It sounds like they have some practical solutions for attracting more readers through optimization techniques as well. Looking forward to it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great subject for a session! It&#039;s always a challenge to layer branding on top of content in a way that actually enhances the content. Very excited to hear what these smart tall people have to say about this excellent topic!]]></description>
