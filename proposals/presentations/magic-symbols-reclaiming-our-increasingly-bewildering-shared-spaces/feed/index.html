		<description><![CDATA[This sounds really interesting. Much of the work I do involves understanding how to leverage emotional responses to capture attention, and I think you&#039;re on the right track with this talk, as the emotions we assign to people, objects and events are what give those things meaning. Very interested in seeing this presentation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comments!

@Andrea: part of the challenge in putting together this presentation is going to be to keep it focused. There is so much ground to cover here... 

BTW, I would welcome a long discussion with you about this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Really intriguing stuff, Jorge.
Cannot say much more than that without actually starting a looOOooong discussion, but I surely hope you have a chance to touch upon the concepts of rhythm and space / time (you mention Lascaux) and existential space as the base for topology and the concept of place in information spaces. Hu. It&#039;s late and I&#039;m getting boring. Ways to go, looking forward to this.]]></description>
