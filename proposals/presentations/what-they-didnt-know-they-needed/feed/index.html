		<description><![CDATA[Megan, I have heard of two of these four techniques but I&#039;m uncertain if any of them are what I think they are. Could you explain a little more about each of the methods you plan to talk about?

Illustrating these methods would make this a solid talk. Are there or real-world examples you could use? Do you plan to include a demonstration of each of these methods?

based on the abstract, I&#039;m a little unclear if this is a methods talk, an inspirational talk, or a blend of both.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This sounds great. I think we too often just talk about the process of gathering customer data, but we don&#039;t talk enough about what to do with that data once you have it. I&#039;d love to see how other people use customer data to drive design.]]></description>
