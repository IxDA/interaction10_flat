		<description><![CDATA[Eric has never under-delivered his presentations. Advertising has always been and will always be part of any medium. Wherever there are people, there will also be ads. I had to work with them (or for them) for too long to know they won&#039;t go away. We might as well learn how to deal with it. I love to see that topics such as this are in the mind of some of us. I WANT IT.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Donna was there when I did this for the first time at the IA Summit in Las Vegas back in 2007. And I left the reference to hookers in just to please Dan :)

The current presentation is significantly updated content-wise, but carries the same basic message - we IX/UX folk just don&#039;t communicate well with the advertising crowd.

BTW, when I say &quot;the economy is picking up&quot; I&#039;m referring to the fact that the business community has recognized that web communications represent low-hanging fruit. Alas, they often choose ad agencies for online solutions because the ad people &quot;don&#039;t complicate things&quot; (true quote).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I saw this talk (in a previous incarnation) at IA Summit (last year?). It is good, damn good. I actually learned some stuff, found some new books to read, and had fun. Can&#039;t do better than that at a conference.

Eric totally knows this stuff!]]></description>
