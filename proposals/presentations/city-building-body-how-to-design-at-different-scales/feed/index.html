		<description><![CDATA[The issues that Ms. Steenson is touching on here are going to become increasingly more important for interaction designers -- and interaction designers are going to have an increasingly more important role in shaping our built environments.

I&#039;ve proposed &lt;a href=&quot;http://interaction.ixda.org/proposals/presentations/magic-symbols-reclaiming-our-increasingly-bewildering-shared-spaces/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a presentation&lt;/a&gt; that will touch on some of these issues as well, but it sounds like Ms. Steenson&#039;s talk comes at this from a different perspective. I&#039;m looking forward to seeing this!]]></description>
