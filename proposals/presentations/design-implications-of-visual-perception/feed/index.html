Seems like a great (and rare) opportunity to learn about how an understanding of human perception can guide visual design, especially from someone who&#039;s both studied the neuroscience of perception as well as practiced interaction design.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This sounds like a great presentation. It would be really helpful to understand the science behind these phenomena. Then, you can create a design that is informed from the start, rather than going with what &quot;looks good&quot; or spending a lot of time experimenting.]]></description>
