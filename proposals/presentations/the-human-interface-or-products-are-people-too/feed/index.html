		<description><![CDATA[@Bob: Really excellent points. In fact, we are already frequently adapting our behaviors to the way computers work instead of the other way around (witness the quasi-lingual way we structure Google queries, or the stunted way we speak when we know a machine is listening). Your thoughts tell me that this is not (at least not always) an issue of making interfaces that are more like humans, but making interfaces that best use the limitations our biological interfaces permit us to have. My contention, still, however, is that a lot of the time the best interface will very much resemble another human. Or at least it should -- I would hate to have to meet the machines halfway, and end up in a world where we converse with both machines and other humans in the same lowest common denominator language, in a  robotic, rigid, de-cultured kind of &quot;newspeak&quot; -- instead of insisting that the machines learn to understand how *we* talk and how *we* want to listen. 

@Joshua: Thanks for the referral, that one is new to me. Norman has been dancing around these ideas for a *long* time.

@Andrew: Thanks, that&#039;s a really good idea. I&#039;ll think about a better lead-in. Hmmm...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chris, this is fascinating! I hope I get a chance to see/hear it. 

Just one bit of feedback - try sharpening up the main point and leading with that. (I thought &quot;The objective is quite simply to inspire designers to humanize their interfaces.&quot; felt like a contender -- but then needs to get concrete, as you do in some of the paragraphs). 

Forward-thinking, less-settled concepts are always harder to get into descriptions like this, no doubt.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Chris -- it sounds like a great talk but given that your asking for input, one thing that might be worth considering is the relative efficacy of humans as interaction devices. In other words, if we were going to design machines to help us better understand and explore, is the human to human interface necessarily the most useful?

When you consider the amount of confusion and ambiguity that tends to accompany human communication, I&#039;m not at all convinced that &quot;people&quot; are that compelling of an interface -- so to speak.

I think history would show that humans and their tools have co-evolved to form sympathetic relationships that support them both. For example, the automobile and the camera are both tools so powerful, useful, and compelling that we have literally altered ourselves and our physical world to fit their needs as much as we&#039;ve changed them to fit ours.

I read your premise as stating that we should look to the real world object of &quot;the human&quot; as a sort of foundational model for human/computer interaction but again, I wonder if there&#039;s more of a middle path where we adapt both our behavior and that of the machine in order to arrive at a unique and modern interactive experience.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The degree of thought and care that Chris has put into his proposal is a clear indication of the depth of his forward thinking.

Too many of us think of interaction design as restricted to the digital realm. The proposed talk shows that interaction design is all around us in multiple spheres and is about the human experience, not the electronic one. 

The risk we often run into at industry conferences is developing tunnel vision and echoing one another. Chris&#039;s approach - to look beyond the digital and beyond our own field to learn from others - is essential if we are to grow, learn and innovate (yes, I wrote &quot;innovate&quot;). 

The premise of products as people is a compelling metaphor. I am certain that Chris has a few surprises for us that will not only shift our thinking but also inspire us to achieve the goal of creating the great experiences that we all desire.

		<description><![CDATA[Rest assured that this is not an absolute position: While I do predict that a century from now three user interface design paradigms will dominate (AI, cybernetics, and agents), the &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; interesting terrain is what comes in between now and then, i.e., in the very near future: How will AI design gradually begin to fall into the interaction designer&#039;s domain? How will understanding human body language become essential to making natural gestural and eventual cybernetic interfaces? How does copywriting&#039;s &quot;voice&quot; make a product more compatible with a user? The theory that interfaces have personalities and that machines are people is, for now, a &lt;i&gt;metaphorical&lt;/i&gt; framework, but one that is already relevant to a great deal of practical interaction design challenges.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hmm - on first read I&#039;m not 100% sure I agree with how absolute this position is. Certainly, the lines between narrative/character design and interaction design will blur, and there are skills all interaction designers will need in that realm - but I&#039;m uneasy about how far one could go in making an argument like this. That said, that only makes me want to hear this talk more. :)]]></description>
