		<description><![CDATA[I agree from a personal perspective that ROI is a weak point and that the obvious common sense arguments for IxD are more compelling.  At the same time, it seems like a discussion of ROI will inevitably come up with biz stakeholders, so I hope you address how to steer away from that and focus on the more compelling reasoning.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the support. Yes, I will continue the IA Summit presentation, which hit a chord, is violently relevant, but can use refinement. One promise: I will start by making and selling Bloody Marys (which made me officially a bootlegger in Tennessee, so why not do it in Georgia, too?).

BTW, &quot;roi&quot; is &quot;king&quot; in French. I&#039;m surprised no one has ever picked up on the pun...&quot;The ROI is dead&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If this is an evolution of his IA Summit talk at all, then it doesn&#039;t need to be a rant. Eric will dazzle us with his delivery, to be sure, and change us with his lessons. It&#039;ll be great!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This sounds like it could start as a lesson and develop into a full-blown rant. Don&#039;t get me wrong, when it&#039;s Eric doing the ranting, that&#039;s a very good thing. I hope to learn a lot from this presentation and I hope to get some anti-ROI-ammunition for those endless yaddayaddayadda arguments.]]></description>
