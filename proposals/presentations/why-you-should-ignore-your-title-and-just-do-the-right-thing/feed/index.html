		<description><![CDATA[Nick,
Thanks for the feedback!

I totally agree that in the hiring, management and promotion of people, job titles and role descriptions are extremely important.  This session was born more out of the feeling that I spend aLOT of time listening to someone tell me what my job is and is NOT while days tick by on a project waiting for the person whose job it is to move it forward.  This session is more a call to action for those with useful skill sets to be empowered to step outside their traditional role and break new ground in terms of who can and should do what.

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think ignoring job titles will actually solve anything.  Look at it from the perspective of the manager.  How do you describe (in a few words) what kind of role/talent/type of people you need to hire without getting into a list of skills, etc?  

Its not about protecting the sandbox, its about identifying what the heck a sandbox is and what makes it different from other things that are not sandboxes and why that difference is important.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Susan,

I find it very interesting that you disagree with a phrase that I used, when the intent of my talk is to try to remind us all that what we produce is way more important than the words we use to describe it or the job titles we hold while creating it.  The word “website” used here is a term I chose very specifically because in my experience, a lot  of what we focus on in this community appears to a user in a browser.  Call it what you will, product, application what have you...Your users most likely refer to it as a website.  In my opinion, creating vocabulary-based walls between us and our users is really no better than building those same type walls between our competencies.  

While I would love to discuss tangible interactions and/or speculative design further, it seems like a whole other presentation topic.  I would love to see a topic like that submitted to an upcoming conference — and perhaps you are the best gal for the job.

Thanks for taking the time to respond,

Abby]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting topic, but saying that &quot;We are all creators — in this case, of websites,&quot; is dated. Interaction designers are creating lots of exciting artifacts not just websites.  

If your intent is to present a manifesto why not discuss tangible interactions, speculative design (e.g., Gaver&#039;s Drift Table) and myriad of other ways designers are shaping user&#039;s experiences away from the desktop? It is this sort of work (I believe) fosters &quot;collaborative spirit&quot; especially among different kinds of designers. 

Good luck!]]></description>
