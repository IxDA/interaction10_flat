		<description><![CDATA[Elizabeth, that&#039;s an interesting question. Not being a Mac person myself, I never thought about that.

Unfortunately, I don&#039;t believe the makers of Xenu offer a Mac version. Although I&#039;m sure there are similar spidering products for the Mac that you could use. But everything else would work on the Mac.  The screen scraper is web based, and Excel is available for Mac. 

I guess the important takeaway idea is that the 10 Minute Content Inventory doesn&#039;t revolve around a single technology. It&#039;s more of an approach to performing content inventories.  Depending on the situation, you might use one facet of it, but not another.  e.g., You might use the scraping, but not the spidering. Or vice versa.]]></description>
