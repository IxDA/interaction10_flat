		<description><![CDATA[Robert, the opportunity to create something truly new and unique is something that we dream of doing. One of the reasons that these opportunities are rare is that they are fraught with risk.

How does one distinguish between a new-category product vs. a fool&#039;s errand? Where does research and design enter into that calculation? They are questions I didn&#039;t see addressed or answered in the proposal.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[FYI that, for further background, you can watch a video of a product we&#039;re likely to demonstrate in this session. Here you&#039;ll see me onstage at DEMO, along with Peter Sweeney (our founder), &lt;a href=&quot;http://corp.primalfusion.com/blog/?p=50&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;launching Primal Fusion&#039;s &quot;thought networking&quot; alpha&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comment, Drew. We definitely intend to show iterations along the way. This session will be approx one part demo and one part lessons learned; we&#039;ll use the demo to illustrate our challenges and drive home some key points about new product design in general.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great idea Bob! Definitely will be a unique offering. I know this is classed as a demo, but i think an interesting aspect of this would be to show the iterations and focus on the failures along the way as a backdrop to where you netted out. I&#039;m looking into attending now... see what you&#039;ve done?! :P]]></description>
