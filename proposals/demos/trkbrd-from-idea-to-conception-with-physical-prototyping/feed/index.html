		<description><![CDATA[Well, I&#039;ve seen it, I&#039;ve played with it, and it&#039;s definitely worth showing to the world!
And like Anders said, it&#039;s not often that a new input device concept gets developed!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Neat! If you get picked, you should use this opportunity to talk a bit about your experiences with Arduino - while your demo itself is great, there&#039;s also a wonderful opportunity here to encourage folks at the conference to start making their own &quot;theoretical ideas&quot; into reality. Hope to see this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;s very rare that a new UI concept is brought into this world, so featuring a concept of this character would undoubtedly garner attention. 

It would certainly be a pleasure attending and seeing a functional version, after following the hype on the web.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m really interested to see the prototype and see it in action on a variety of surfaces including skin, hair, etc. From what I hear, even NO surface will work, just in the air! Hope this demo gets picked.]]></description>
