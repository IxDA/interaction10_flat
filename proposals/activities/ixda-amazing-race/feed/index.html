		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m all for this idea! 

One of the worst parts about attending a conference is that we travel great distances and hardly get to experience the city we&#039;re in. 

We spend so much time in meeting rooms and hotel rooms that an activity of this nature is more than welcome. I&#039;m with MJ on this one!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here are some of the potential challenges and possible solutions: 

 Time: If we were to do this all in one day, the number of tasks that each team needs to accomplish can be limited to 3 or so based on the time. Alternatively, we can also incorporate the events of the race over a couple of days during social hours/free time.  
 Planning/Set Up: Along with race participants, a team of people will be needed to make the game work.  From setting up discrete clues around the conference area and the city, there will be a &quot;control&quot; center that will help monitor the race through mobile check-ins. 


In a game like this, while the destination may be the end goal, the journey is the key takeaway. So, we&#039;ll strive to keep it simple, uphold the spirit of the Amazing Race, and have a lot of fun along the way!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This sounds like a blast! If it isn&#039;t chosen as a session, I&#039;m game to help make it an elective event during social hours. (This year&#039;s GEL conference in NYC had an urban safari as a precon activity: big fun.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What an interesting idea!  I&#039;ve always thought that we can learn so much about interaction design by observing the world around us - after all, we&#039;re designing for people and that&#039;s where the people live!]]></description>
