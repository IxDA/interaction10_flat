		<description><![CDATA[This sounds like a cool concept. How do you propose to divide the time between the talk and the activity? 

Like Livia, I&#039;m curious what kind of activity you propose as it isn&#039;t clear from the summary.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[jakiamik,

The focus of the work that generated these findings was a project that challenged us to breakdown large scale applications into more &quot;job-grained&quot; solutions. We came away with a series of principles for identifying mini apps taking the POV of the end user. Our experience did not find user wanting to &quot;design&quot; solutions, but rather consume and utilize them. Thanks for our comments.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[software as a service has been contributing to this horizon for several years.  while it is agreed that smaller applications have been the direction development has moved recently, it might be suggested that developing a simplistic mechanism to allow users to design their own solutions &#039;on the fly&#039; is the more realistic long term vision.
