		<description><![CDATA[MJ, this sounds similar to Dave Gray&#039;s visual thinking mini-workshops and the revelation that participants CAN draw is amazing to see. We&#039;ve had several moments like that as part of the VizThink Toronto community. 

I&#039;m all for this session!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This program sounds great! This is a skill that everyone can benefit from -- the ability (and the courage!) to sketch out a drawing on the fly in order to more effectively communicate ones ideas; using visuals to support, clarify and sell one&#039;s message.]]></description>
