		<description><![CDATA[Johanna, this sounds like a fun and educational activity. 

I&#039;ve participated in collaborative games at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://canux.nform.ca&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Canux workshop&lt;/a&gt;, led by the Banff Centre Leadership team. The consensus at the end of the process was that while the games were very useful in uncovering insights in a conference environment, attempting these activities in most corporate environments would be extremely challenging at best.

What kinds of games do you propose? Are they borrowed from other disciplines or are they games of your own design?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Making workshops and teams work better together - and more importantly,  quickly given the time we sometime have - would be very worthwhile. 

Best of luck running the session. I&#039;d love to see a presentation/video after the event to see how it went [I&#039;ll not be able to  make the conference].]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Couldn&#039;t agree more Johanna. Games seem to be a a largely un-tapped resource for the a lot of UX-ers. I&#039;d be really interested in participating in this session.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for your comment, Brad. Games can highlight implicit issues, such as conflicts within the team or different roles people take on. Hence they can be a powerful tool to trigger reflection and conversation. A facilitator needs to be aware of these issues. How to deal with conflicts and insights that arise from team activities will be a main focus of the workshop. Games are fun - as long as you know how to play.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The reason why games work so well as brainstorming and team building tools is it adds that sense of fun to our everyday work. The more fun we have doing our work, the more creative and innovative our work can be. Can&#039;t wait to see how this session might help instruct others on how to properly do this.]]></description>
