		<description><![CDATA[This is a nice approach. May want to reassure committee how you&#039;ll manage the time, and point out take-aways or outcomes you aim to have. Also, you and Kaleem may want to discuss teaming up, to avoid these cancelling each other out somehow?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Though I haven&#039;t written about it much, this subject is near and dear to me.  However, I think about it mostly from the perspective of the ethics of doing the work of design, not the ethics of design decisions.  So my feedback is around that. Given that we may decide that some design decisions are unethical, then what? Do and how do we enforce, individually and/or as a community, the ethics of design practice? For example, how would we identify and prevent getting caught up in questionable or objectionable design efforts even before we confront individual potentially unethical design choices? I would like to see those questions addressed in a session such as this.]]></description>
