		<description><![CDATA[Love this idea. We see so many candidates who think they&#039;re going to dazzle us with the end product. Great finished work is nice, but before we hire anyone, we need to know how they get from A to B. Hope this gets picked!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m very interested in this discussion. This would be worth the trip to the conference alone. I&#039;ve recently been in the position to hire several ux contractors and the process has been very frustrating. The formatting of the resumes and portfolios makes it very difficult to assess the talent of the candidates. This is a pain point in my profession that really needs illuminating. I think there are probably many talented people not getting jobs because they don&#039;t know how to represent their methodology or quality of thinking in their portfolio.]]></description>
