		<description><![CDATA[Thanks all, for the comments. I agree it&#039;s the magic that is the hardest to talk about, and I guess that&#039;s exactly why I&#039;m interested in pursuing it. 

Externalizing these patterns of thinking will go a long way toward demystifying and illustrating value of analysis and synthesis for those who aren&#039;t practitioners-hopefully improving design outcomes in the process.

Katherine, thanks for the comments. I agree, I am attempting a fairly methodical look at the activities underlying analysis and synthesis. I&#039;ve enjoyed your last few blog posts on the topic, and look forward to hearing more about how your IDSA presentation went.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;...too much focus on the “tools” themselves leads to method fetishization (i.e., personas) where the purpose of the tool may be obscured by the tool itself.&quot;  

Hear hear, and well put, John. The EPIC 2009 session was excellent, and good luck with this next one. I would categorize your approach to analysis as systematic, methodical, thorough, and process focused. The kit of tools I&#039;ve been assembling is coming from a completely different direction: less systematic; based on the metaphor of multiple mindsets looking at the same data. I help designers see the data through the lenses of those mindsets. 

I don&#039;t know, yet, how I will reconcile both our approaches, but my participating in the workshop at EPIC 2009 has invigorated my work in design research and analysis most certainly. As far as I&#039;m concerned, the more ways one can look at the data, the more insights one can pull from it. All good.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi John,

As far as I&#039;m concerned, it&#039;s talking about the magic that&#039;s difficult. It&#039;s not like we can point to a single point of data to explain a design decision or a conclusion. We take observational data, knowledge of human perception &amp; behavior, aesthetic sensibility, interaction patterns and put them in a big blender to come up with a conclusion. 

But all of this is just so fundamental... yes, we can point to observations and discuss a little about what we observed and how humans work, but beyond that it&#039;s like trying to describe how Photoshop works... in *machine language.*]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comments Steve, Fred, and Elizabeth.

As this is a discussion presentation, I thought I&#039;d pose a question for those who are interested. Any feedback will be carried directly into the discussion at IxDA if selected.

&quot;What do you find difficult about describing analysis / synthesis practices to clients or colleagues?&quot;

I&#039;d love to hear your thoughts...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As the cartoon goes, &quot;And then a miracle happens.&quot; This discussion seems aimed at making it more intentional and less miraculous.

Although I think I might have more to learn than to contribute to this one, I would love to attend.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John, I heartily second Steve&#039;s recommendation. I&#039;ve been able to apply some of what Steve has written on this subject in my practice and it&#039;s been very helpful. 

There is a certain magic to design activities in the research analysis phase, and there is definitely value in being able to talk about that magic intelligently. In my experience, it gives clients more confidence in the value &amp; usefulness of our work.

Also, I cannot imagine a world in which this discussion would not be accepted.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Needless to say I think this is an awesome idea. As a community we really need to arrive at a deeper understanding of such a fundamental component of the work we do on a day-to-day basis.

And John, if this doesn&#039;t get up, we should talk :)]]></description>
