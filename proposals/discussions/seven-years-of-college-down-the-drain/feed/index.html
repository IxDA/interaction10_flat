		<description><![CDATA[Brad, thanks for the props!

Dan, I admit that I opened this up to &quot;a User Experience Skills and Strategies curriculum&quot; on purpose, hoping that since it was a discussion the focus would evolve organically from the participants.  But maybe you&#039;re right, maybe it would degenerate into a series of disconnected monologues.

Nah...I&#039;m too good a moderator for that.

But seriously...thanks for the feedback, it&#039;s great food for thought (and it really means a lot to get thoughtful criticism from someone I really admire).  Would love to hear if anyone else would prefer the topic to be broader or narrower.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting, but seems to broad for I10. More like a SxSW topic. Not enough IxD focus.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This sounds like a great concept, and one many companies could learn much from. Many companies don&#039;t have well defined continued education policies for their employees, which is a real shame. Hope to get the chance to attend this discussion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rob-
I believe you do understand correctly,  The idea is to have a structured education plan within your capability designed to improve the skills of the practitioners and expand the skills of the group.

I have seen some companies (mine included) that do annual &quot;bootcamps&quot;, but I think this concept is fairly uncommon.  Would love to discuss it with others.

Many thanks for the feedback!

		<description><![CDATA[If I understand the topic correctly, I am quite interested. The practice at a previous employer, was to hire good &quot;people&quot; with knowledge of the domain, but with the expectation that the team would train this person to our flavor of UI and IxD design. It worked out, but was also troublesome. Interesting idea to set out a formal education plan for a new hire, for example, before they are hired.]]></description>
