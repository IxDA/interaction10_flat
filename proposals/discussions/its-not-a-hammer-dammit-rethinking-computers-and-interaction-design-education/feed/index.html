		<description><![CDATA[I hear that &quot;just a tool&quot; line all the time. Yeah, the computer&#039;s a tool, but so&#039;s a particle accelerator. Even a hammer needs some explanation the first time you come across one.

A computer&#039;s guts may not be that complicated (debatable), but the workflow and the power it provides certainly is. I work in a prepress department, and I see a lot of misuses of this simple tool. So when I teach a graphics class, I explain everything from folder/directory structure to what happens to your files downstream (when the printer or webmaster has to deal with them). I love tutorials -- lynda.com is what I use to teach classes. But tutorials won&#039;t take care of most computer-related problems. And the hammer analogy doesn&#039;t stand a chance.]]></description>
