		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Praveen. Good points. 
I&#039;m curious too about ownership/responsibility and work products. Are you in fact producing use cases? I feel we need to be involved in whatever artifacts specify interaction--if we don&#039;t &quot;own&quot; them, at least we have right of refusal. Whenever use cases or user stories are written by non-UX people, I feel there&#039;s a disjunct between the intended interaction design and the realized one.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Joe,
This is my third project in Keane where I am working with BAs. Over the time, we all (IAs and BAs) have realized the glitches and pain points that prevailed during the process. Of course, we started as distinct groups without coherence, however, over time we have modified our process to include new teams.
Even if we do not like it, BAs will be there on the projects. If not in one company, you would find in other. Instead of running away, together we worked as a team - of course with lot of fights and heated arguments) and redefined the process.

BAs need to collect only business requirements and nothing more than that. In some circumstances, they might also collect system requirements but shall stay aloof from user interface requirements.

Our process dictates 1 BA to 1 IA. We go together in requirement gathering meetings and try to do quick white boarding sessions followed by paper prototypes. This way, the process of collecting requirements become faster. Client also understands wireframe much better than usecases.
IAs: They create wireframes and document all the interactions with all possible flows using screenshots in Interaction Gudieline documents. This document evolves as it goes from IA to VD, who updates it with visually designed screenshots and also updates for any new changes introduced by her.
The development team finally gets two documents: usecases and interaction guidelines for each usecase.
This has helped us at Keane and I am sure it would work everywhere.
