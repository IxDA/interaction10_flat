		<description><![CDATA[We have all had failures. Hopefully the scale of them diminishes as our experience grows.  This would be a great session to share client reactions and our solutions. Everyone would have a story to tell. I too like the fact that the session will be private and anonymous.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[THIS SESSION WILL BE PRIVATE AND ANONYMOUS.

Thanks, Scott and Trevor for your feedback and insights. 

I should have made it clear at the outset (instead of at the conclusion) that participation in this session will be private and anonymous.

Organizers: Is there a way to edit the proposal itself?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a refreshingly candid approach that I fear might scare some people off. Failures are not something that most of us do not want to admit to (especially if we&#039;re used to success). Emphasizing that participation is private and anonymous would likely increase attendance at this presentation. I would love to see a session like this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the feedback, Dan. And it&#039;s MY failure that I used a jargonish phrase to describe what&#039;s an otherwise clear concept.

&lt;em&gt;IN CAMERA means that the session will be private and outside of the view of the general public&lt;/em&gt;. Only the participants themselves will know who was in the session. Typically the discussion at an in camera session is not shared outside the room (eg. a judge&#039;s chambers) but the purpose of the session is to learn, which is why I suggested capturing and anonymising knowledge.

The inspiration for this session comes from realising the parallels between conversations that I&#039;ve had with peers and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity_and_Mortality&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;morbidity and mortality&lt;/a&gt; peer review sessions that medical staff use to identify errors to improve patient care. These sessions are also important in identifying systemic issues that affect success.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like that you&#039;re saying out loud what so many folks keep to themselves: Failure is a great teacher. It&#039;s an excellent starting point for a presentation. One thing: I don&#039;t know what an &quot;in camera session&quot; is. (Probably MY failure.)]]></description>
