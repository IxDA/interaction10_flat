		<description><![CDATA[I believe that one possible argument to  answer the question is to make some academic activities directed to local professional goals.

Because professional necessities are in most cases directed by goals, (client goals, social goals, profit goals), the use of some of this goals could be helpful in an integration of academic and professional activities.

Other problems can surge: if a school team makes a professional work, it can be complicated. But, if it was possible to join groups around isolated applications joined in major objectives, it could be interesting.

It makes some sense?]]></description>
