		<description><![CDATA[I see a future where prototypes become products as well. Where as designers say &quot;rapid prototyping&quot;, the general public refers to it as &quot;3D printing&quot;, which presumes that the result is already a product itself, which it of course may very well be. Maybe we are moving towards interactions that prototype themselves &quot;on the fly&quot; as they are being spewed out of a printer. Testing and use will be the same thing. Maybe.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This piece has always been an area of interest for me.. “Why and how different people are prototyping experiences?” “How they affect natural gestural interactions?” 

Also glad to see that you are touching upon &quot;creating unnatural reactions&quot;..technology, i feel should never be forced upon..there is a huge potential in bridging the gap betn face-face interaction and technology aided interaction.

Extremely interesting thoughts here..would love to hear in detail.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice!
As for me, not only is the question of misleading subjects interesting. 
But also the misleading of designers themselves.
If a certain level of finishing excludes a direction, and yet if the prototype would have been done differently (although all at the same level) would it influence which direction would have been chosen??

The &#039;road not taken&#039; paradigm.

Will these discussions be recorded? transcribes?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very interesting!!! I particularly liked this bit &quot; A purpose-oriented, well executed prototype can provide a platform for user to experience product interactions. At the same time a well executed prototype without a definitive purpose may do more harm than good and can tamper natural interactions and force behavior(s)&quot; 

Would love to see what arguments you have to support your Idea and debate? What about disruptive technologies...things developed out of context..not considering users in mind...sometime successful?

Is it wrong to change users behaviour by using prototypes?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very good questions. It is important to stress content, and to think of &quot;why&quot; do something instead of just be fascinated by the technological possibilities of the day and be stuck in the &quot;how&quot; aspects.]]></description>
