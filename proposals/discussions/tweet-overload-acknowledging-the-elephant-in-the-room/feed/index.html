		<description><![CDATA[I very much like your topic. My experience with &quot;Debunking myths about the human brain and multitasking&quot;:

I lecture at the Avans University of Applied Sciences in Breda, the Netherlands. Since my students follow the bachelor programme &quot;communication and multimedia design&quot;, I tended to approve that students (18+) used their laptops during my speech. I knew, however, that they were using msn and other communication means. I used to test their ability of multitasking by questioning them about what I was telling just before. I&#039;ve come to the conclusion that their multitasking abilities are very poor, although they believed to be very succesful multitaskers. 

On the other hand: when I&#039;m under the impression that my 7 year old daughter hasn&#039;t heared my explanation on why I don&#039;t want her to do X and I check, she always perfectly repeats the full sentence.....
Maybe the early &quot;digital natives&quot; are not yet fully operational multitaskers, but they certainly are getting better!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think your proposed topic is interesting ... and your comment that Twitter is just the latest example is critical. Yes, I agree you should include content about the effectiveness of multitasking. This recent item in the NYT was interesting: 

http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/30/weekinreview/30pennebaker.html 

It sites a study published in the August 24 edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 

As a &quot;business guy&quot;, I have been struck with the number of communication technologies that each information worker must cope with minute-to-minute in their job. Of course the basics ... phone and email. Many companies now include chat applications as part of the core desktop. Add mobile-phone based interactions (and the immediately interrupting &quot;walkie-talkie&quot; style communicators). 

The core question are the social / cultural expectations, and how a company (or any organization) establishes norms of behavior. Should every phone call be answered? If not, must every voice-mail message be returned? Does each email require a response? To: vs. CC:? Aliases or groups? Under what circumstances may I ignore a specific medium? It&#039;s all about the norms. 

Good Luck!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Perfect. I got sucked into a weird frenetic tweeting experience at Interaction09. It was very exciting, but I felt very guilty for stepping so far outside the in-room experience (admittedly I have a short attention span) but fascinated by the intensity of the dialog online and how it was relevant and continued to the hallway conversations; on one hand it felt like we created more conversation; on the other hand, it was definitely not living up to things I value like being present, being here, etc. etc. Can&#039;t wait to see this presentation, especially if mellophone is included.]]></description>
