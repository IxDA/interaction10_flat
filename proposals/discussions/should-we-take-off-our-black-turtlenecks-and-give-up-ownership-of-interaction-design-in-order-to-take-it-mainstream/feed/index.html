	<title>Comments on: Should we take off our black turtlenecks and give up &#8220;ownership&#8221; of interaction design in order to take it mainstream?</title>

		<description><![CDATA[If we give up ownership, does the product and design start to become lackluster, mushy, or lack a strong point-of-view? Does it become more of a design by committee? And is this a good thing or bad? Or, do all the collaborative owners add insights that other owners have not considered? I&#039;m looking forward to hearing the IxD field&#039;s POV! To own or not to own?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comments...

Christian--Yes we will go into how relaxing constraints can really unleash innovation. 

DeAnn--Your point is key as this approach does just that by leveraging non-designers in the process. 

Rodrigo--Yes many companies do this and yet don&#039;t setup product managers for success. That&#039;s a key difference with our approach.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hiya, I&#039;m curious to hear your conclusions. My sense is that whether we like it or not, lots of people in companies already feel some ownership over &quot;design&quot;. Product managers and the like always voice their opinions on whether X should be blue or green, or a few pixels here or there. Makes sense to institutionalize the fact that ownership is distributed.]]></description>
